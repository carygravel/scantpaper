We use the deprecated install class since it provides the easiest way to install
data files outside of a Python package. This feature is needed for the
translation files, which must reside in <sys.prefix>/share/locale for the Glade
file to pick them up.

An alternative would be to build the translation files with a separate command,
but that would require changing all package scripts for all distributions.

scantpaper can control flatbed or sheet-fed (ADF) scanners with SANE via
SANE, and can scan multiple,pages at once. It presents a thumbnail view of
scanned pages, and permits simple operations such as cropping, rotating and
deleting pages.

OCR can be used to recognise text in the scans, and the output embedded in the
PDF or DjVu.

PDF conversion is done by ocrmypdf.

Usage: scanimage [OPTION]...

Start image acquisition on a scanner device and write PNM image data to
standard output.

-d, --device-name=DEVICE   use a given scanner device (e.g. hp:/dev/scanner)
    --format=pnm|tiff      file format of output file
-i, --icc-profile=PROFILE  include this ICC profile into TIFF file
-L, --list-devices         show available scanner devices
-f, --formatted-device-list=FORMAT similar to -L, but the FORMAT of the output
                           can be specified: %d (device name), %v (vendor),
                           %m (model), %t (type), and %i (index number)
-b, --batch[=FORMAT]       working in batch mode, FORMAT is `out%d.pnm' or
                           `out%d.tif' by default depending on --format
    --batch-start=#        page number to start naming files with
    --batch-count=#        how many pages to scan in batch mode
    --batch-increment=#    increase number in filename by an amount of #
    --batch-double         increment page number by two for 2sided originals
                           being scanned in a single sided scanner
    --batch-prompt         ask for pressing a key before scanning a page
    --accept-md5-only      only accept authorization requests using md5

-h, --help                 display this help message and exit
-v, --verbose              give even more status messages
-B, --buffer-size          change default input buffersize
-V, --version              print version information

Options specific to device `snapscan:libusb:005:007':
  Scan Mode:
    --resolution auto||50|150|200|240|266|300|350|360|400|600|720|800|1200|1600|3200dpi [300]
        Sets the resolution of the scanned image.
    --preview[=(auto|yes|no)] [no]

    --mode auto|Color|Gray|Lineart [Color]
        Selects the scan mode (e.g., lineart, monochrome, or color).
    --preview-mode auto|Auto|Color|Gray|Lineart [Auto]
        Select the mode for previews. Greyscale previews usually give the best
        combination of speed and detail.
    --high-quality[=(auto|yes|no)] [no]
        Highest quality but lower speed
    --source auto|Flatbed|Transparency Adapter [Flatbed]
        Selects the scan source (such as a document-feeder).
  Geometry:
    -l auto|0..216mm [0]
        Top-left x position of scan area.
    -t auto|0..297mm [0]
        Top-left y position of scan area.
    -x auto|0..216mm [216]
        Width of scan-area.
    -y auto|0..297mm [297]
        Height of scan-area.
    --predef-window None|6x4 (inch)|8x10 (inch)|8.5x11 (inch) [None]
        Provides standard scanning areas for photographs, printed pages and
        the like.
  Enhancement:
    --depth 8|16bit [8]
        Number of bits per sample, typical values are 1 for "line-art" and 8
        for multibit scans.
    --quality-cal[=(yes|no)] [yes]
        Do a quality white-calibration
    --halftoning[=(yes|no)] [inactive]
        Selects whether the acquired image should be halftoned (dithered).
    --halftone-pattern DispersedDot8x8|DispersedDot16x16 [inactive]
        Defines the halftoning (dithering) pattern for scanning halftoned
        images.
    --custom-gamma[=(yes|no)] [no]
        Determines whether a builtin or a custom gamma-table should be used.
    --analog-gamma-bind[=(yes|no)] [no]
        In RGB-mode use same values for each color
    --analog-gamma 0..4 [inactive]
        Analog gamma-correction
    --analog-gamma-r 0..4 [1.79999]
        Analog gamma-correction for red
    --analog-gamma-g 0..4 [1.79999]
        Analog gamma-correction for green
    --analog-gamma-b 0..4 [1.79999]
        Analog gamma-correction for blue
    --gamma-table 0..65535,... (in steps of 1) [inactive]
        Gamma-correction table.  In color mode this option equally affects the
        red, green, and blue channels simultaneously (i.e., it is an intensity
        gamma table).
    --red-gamma-table 0..65535,... (in steps of 1) [inactive]
        Gamma-correction table for the red band.
    --green-gamma-table 0..65535,... (in steps of 1) [inactive]
        Gamma-correction table for the green band.
    --blue-gamma-table 0..65535,... (in steps of 1) [inactive]
        Gamma-correction table for the blue band.
    --negative[=(auto|yes|no)] [inactive]
        Swap black and white
    --threshold 0..100% (in steps of 1) [inactive]
        Select minimum-brightness to get a white point
    --brightness -400..400% (in steps of 1) [0]
        Controls the brightness of the acquired image.
    --contrast -100..400% (in steps of 1) [0]
        Controls the contrast of the acquired image.
  Advanced:
    --rgb-lpr auto|1..50 (in steps of 1) [4]
        Number of scan lines to request in a SCSI read. Changing this
        parameter allows you to tune the speed at which data is read from the
        scanner during scans. If this is set too low, the scanner will have to
        stop periodically in the middle of a scan; if it's set too high,
        X-based frontends may stop responding to X events and your system could
        bog down.
    --gs-lpr auto|1..50 (in steps of 1) [inactive]
        Number of scan lines to request in a SCSI read. Changing this
        parameter allows you to tune the speed at which data is read from the
        scanner during scans. If this is set too low, the scanner will have to
        stop periodically in the middle of a scan; if it's set too high,
        X-based frontends may stop responding to X events and your system could
        bog down.
